Problem Statement:
    Planning a trip gives everyone time to thoughtfully consider where they'd like to go and what 
    they'd like to experience. Issues that tourists face are not having proper knowledge of the location
    and a fear of getting misguided by local people. Moreover, people who go on business trips are not 
    able to explore the places due to time constraints and not having the proper information

Proposed Solution:
    - Search destinations based on preferred seasons, sightseeing, itinerary templates, and public reviews.
    - Calendar sync-up for business trip travelers
    - Geo-tagging features of all our travelers for safety purposes
    - Guided trips to risky places with a trained guide (subscription based)
    - Collaborative online whiteboard for teams to ideate and brainstorm together

Technology Stack:
    Framework - Flutter
    Language - Dart
    Database - Firebase
    API - Flutter explore Edition SDK
